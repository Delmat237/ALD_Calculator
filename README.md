Hello dear allðŸ˜‰
I'm coding a calculator in python.
I would like it to contain not only basic operations such as 
âœ”addition, 
âœ”multiplication ,
âœ”substraction ,
âœ”division 
âœ”trigonometric calculations,
(â˜žï¾Ÿãƒ®ï¾Ÿ)â˜žbut also matrix calculation and a little digital analysis 
primitive, derivative,etc
