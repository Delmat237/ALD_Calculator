# Hello dear allðŸ˜‰
## I'm coding a calculator in python.
I would like it to contain not only basic operations such as 
- [x] **addition**, 
- [x] **multiplication** ,
- [x] **substraction** ,
- [x] **division** 
- [x] **trigonometric calculations**,
 -[] **(â˜žï¾Ÿãƒ®ï¾Ÿ)â˜ž**but also matrix calculation and a little digital analysis 
*primitive*, *derivative*,etc
